# The Normalisation of Explicit Content in Hip-Hop (1990-2018)

### 📌 Introduction
This project looks at how "explicit" language in Hip-Hop/Rap has changed over the last 30 years.

By comparing **trends over time**, **genres**, and **sales data**, I wanted to answer a simple question: Do artists *need* to swear to get famous, or is it just a style choice?

The dashboard below visualises the story of how Hip-Hop lyrics have changed.

### ❓ Questions I Wanted to Answer
1. **Trends:** How much has swearing actually increased from 1990 to 2018?
2. **Genre:** Is the "Explicit" label mostly just for Hip-Hop/Rap, or do other genres do it too?
3. **Sales:** Does using more swear words actually make a song more popular?

### 📊 Composite Visualisation

### 💡 Key Takeaways
* **It’s Increasing:** Profanity in Hip-Hop has gone up steadily. In the 90s, songs averaged 5 swear words; by 2018, that number jumped to nearly 15 per song.
* **It’s a Hip-Hop Thing:** The "Explicit" warning is almost entirely defined by this genre. Hip-Hop makes up **88%** of all explicit tracks in this dataset (1990-2018).
* **Swearing $\neq$ Success:** Contrary to the idea that "shock value" sells, there is no link between more swearing and higher sales. In fact, the data shows a **slight negative link** ($R = -0.134$)—meaning cleaner songs often perform just as well, if not better.
